The script calculates the first two principal components (PC) of an n*d dimensional data set, transforms the dataset on the two PCs and plots the free ebergy (-log of probability) of the  data-set on each of the PCs as well as on the two PCs simutaneously. Finally, it calculates the mutual information between the two PCs.                                                   
                                                                                               
Input command to run the program: python pca.py <data-file name>                              

Output: Three plots with the free energies and an output file named 'output.txt' with a more  detailed output, like eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, eigenvectors and PC vectors
